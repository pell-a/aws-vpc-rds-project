# AWS VPC with EC2 and RDS Integration

## Overview
This project demonstrates the creation of a secure and scalable AWS architecture using the following services:
- VPC
- EC2
- RDS
- CloudWatch

## Architecture
The architecture includes:
- A custom VPC with public and private subnets for network segmentation.
- EC2 instance in the public subnet for application hosting.
- RDS instance in the private subnet for secure database storage.
- CloudWatch for monitoring and alerting on system performance.

## Key Features
- Network Isolation: Public and private subnets with NAT Gateway and route tables.
- Resource Security: Security group rules to restrict inbound and outbound traffic.
- Monitoring: CloudWatch metrics, alarms, and enhanced monitoring for RDS.

## Steps Implemented
1. Created a custom VPC with subnets and an internet gateway.
2. Configured security groups for EC2 and RDS instances.
3. Connected EC2 to RDS for database access.
4. Enabled CloudWatch monitoring and set alarms for performance thresholds.
